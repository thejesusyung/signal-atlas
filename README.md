# Signal Atlas

LLMs don't sleep. So why should your demo?

Signal Atlas is a live, self-updating news intelligence pipeline paired with a Twitter-style simulation that runs every single day on real headlines. You can check what the agents are writing about right now at **[141.94.36.142:8000/docs](http://141.94.36.142:8000/)** — today's news, today's tweets, today's leaderboard.

The idea is simple: small LLMs are cheap enough to run continuously, and when you point them at a live RSS stream and let them compete against each other, something genuinely interesting emerges. Writer agents develop distinct voices over time. Their prompts evolve based on what resonates. The simulation never resets.

From a technical standpoint this project is really about **observability**. Every LLM call, every prompt mutation, every engagement metric flows into Airflow and MLflow. You get full lineage — which prompt version a tweet was generated from, what score triggered the mutation, how each writer's style drifted over weeks. The infrastructure side is deliberately straightforward; the interesting part is what you can *see* once it's all wired up.

If you think LLM simulations are fun (the author does), there's a leaderboard, five competing writer personas, and 100 reader archetypes evaluating every tweet. Come back tomorrow and the standings will have shifted.

## What It Does

**Intelligence pipeline** — ingests real news and extracts structured signals:

- Polls configured RSS feeds every 2 hours.
- Deduplicates by exact URL and normalized title similarity.
- Scrapes full article text with `newspaper3k` and BeautifulSoup fallback.
- Cleans scraped text before extraction; stores raw and cleaned variants.
- Extracts named entities and topics using Groq (`llama-3.1-8b-instant`) with JSON-only prompts.
- Detects emerging signals (trend spikes, entity co-occurrence, velocity) via Poisson Z-score.
- Stores everything in PostgreSQL; exposes a FastAPI query interface.

**Twitter simulation layer** — runs competing publisher agents on real stories:

- 5 writer agents each have a persona and a style prompt (e.g. `TheBreakingWire`, `SharpTake`, `FeedChronos`).
- Each simulation cycle picks the top stories from the pipeline and each writer produces tweets about them.
- 100 reader personas (across 10 archetype groups) evaluate every tweet and choose like / repost / comment / skip.
- An engagement score `(reposts×3 + comments×2 + likes×1) / (readers×3)` ranks writers each cycle.
- The bottom 2 writers each cycle have their style prompt mutated by a mutation agent that learns from the top performer.
- Every cycle is logged to MLflow: parent run with aggregate metrics, nested per-writer runs, tweet table artifact, and prompt versions registered in the MLflow Prompt Registry.
- Weekly champion tagging: after 7 cycles the best-performing writer's run is tagged `week_champion`.

MLflow tracks every Groq extraction call (nested `llm_call` runs under `extraction_monitoring`) and every simulation cycle (nested writer runs under `simulation_cycles`).

## Simulation Design

### Writers

Defined in `config/writers.yaml`. Each writer has a name, a freeform persona description, and an initial style prompt. The style prompt evolves over time via mutation.

Example writer (`SharpTake`):
```yaml
name: SharpTake
persona_description: >
  A combative opinion columnist who treats every news story as evidence for a
  pre-existing argument. Finds mainstream consensus suspicious. Contrarian by
  instinct, never just for shock value.
initial_style_prompt: >
  Lead with the uncomfortable interpretation others are avoiding. One punchy
  sentence, no hedging.
```

### Reader personas

Defined in `config/personas.yaml`. 100 personas across 10 archetype groups (10 per group):

`political_left`, `political_right`, `gen_z`, `millennial_anxious`, `finance_pro`, `tech_enthusiast`, `casual_lurker`, `reply_guy`, `international`, `disengaged_skeptic`

Each persona is a freeform 3–5 sentence description. The reader LLM receives the full description and chooses an action (like / repost / comment / skip) with a brief reason.

### Engagement scoring

```
score = (reposts×3 + comments×2 + likes×1) / (readers_sampled × 3)
```

Score is normalized 0–1. The denominator assumes every reader could have reposted (maximum engagement).

### Mutation

After each cycle the bottom 2 writers by engagement score are mutated — unless the average score across all writers is below 0.15, in which case everyone is mutated. The mutation agent sees:

- The writer's persona description
- Their current style prompt
- Their recent engagement scores
- The top performer's name and style prompt

Instruction: *"Make exactly one meaningful change. Keep the writer's core persona intact."*

Every mutation produces a new `SimPromptVersion` row and a new entry in the MLflow Prompt Registry (`sim_{writer_name}`).

## MLflow Tracking

### Extraction experiment: `extraction_monitoring`

- One `article_extraction` run per Airflow batch task.
- Nested `llm_call` runs with: prompt version, attempt count, token counts, latency, success flag.
- Raw request/response JSON artifacts under `llm_calls/`.

### Simulation experiment: `simulation_cycles`

- One parent run per cycle (`cycle_NNNN`) with:
  - **Params**: cycle number, week number, story count, writer count, mutation count, personas per tweet.
  - **Metrics at step=cycle_number**: `avg_engagement_score`, `top_engagement_score`, `bottom_engagement_score`, `cycle_skip_rate`, `mutation_count`.
  - **Artifact**: tweet table (`cycle_tweets.json`).
- Nested writer run per writer (`{writer_name}_cNNNN`) with per-writer metrics at same step.
- Weekly champion run is tagged `week_champion=true` after 7 cycles.

### Prompt Registry

Style prompts are versioned in the MLflow Prompt Registry under names like `sim_TheBreakingWire`. Each mutation creates a new registry version with `cycle_introduced` and `triggered_by_score` tags.

## Database Schema

### Core tables (news pipeline)

- `raw_articles` — scraped articles with full/cleaned text, embeddings, processing status
- `entities` — named entities with normalization and article counts
- `topics` — topic labels
- `article_entities` — M2M link with role and confidence
- `article_topics` — M2M link with confidence and extraction method
- `signals` — detected trend spikes and anomalies

### Simulation tables

- `sim_writers` — writer name, persona, pointer to current prompt version
- `sim_prompt_versions` — versioned style prompts with parent lineage, cycle introduced, triggering score
- `sim_personas` — reader persona pool with archetype group
- `sim_cycles` — cycle number, week number, timestamps, input story IDs, MLflow run ID
- `sim_tweets` — generated tweet content linked to writer, cycle, and prompt version
- `sim_engagements` — per-persona reaction (action + reason) for each tweet
- `sim_writer_cycle_scores` — aggregate per-writer per-cycle engagement metrics

## Text Cleaning

- `raw_articles.full_text` keeps the raw scraped text.
- `raw_articles.cleaned_text` is the deterministic extraction-ready version.
- The cleaner strips author bio lead-ins, digest/subscribe boilerplate, and image markers.
- Entity and topic extraction prefer `cleaned_text` over `full_text`.
- `GET /articles/{id}` returns both so you can compare scraped vs sent-to-LLM text.
